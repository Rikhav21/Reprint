            Remodel YSWS
        </h1>
        <pi>
            Have you ever looked at a 3d printer and thought that you could have done a better job? Well this is a WSWS where you can redesign some "suboptimal" printers and get the grant to make it yourself!
        </pi>
        <p2>
            To get started you can take a look at the available printers. Either you can can choose one of these from aliexpress, or you can find any printer less than $80 from facebook marketplace, ebay, etc.
        </p2>
        <p3>
            Once you have your printer, you can start redesigning it! You can use any CAD software you cant, but if this your your first experioeince with CAD, we recommend using Fusion 360 or onshape.

            So for your mod to get approved, you are going to need:
            <ul>
                <li>A full 3d model of the printer with the mod</li>
                <li>Updated firmware to integrate with the mod</li>
                <li>A journal detailing what ou did, in a journal.md</li>
                <li>A README.md including a picture of your CAD rendering</li>
