            So you have to make 1 high quality mod (Look at ideas tab) and then you can either get a used printer from ebay or facebook marketplace(Max $50) or if that is not availible, get a printer from aliexpress(Max $80)
            Then you will also get a grant to build your mod on the printer, where the total cost of the mod+printer is less than $150
            Then you can repeat design more mods and get the grant to build them (Max $100)
            Finally, if you make more than 3 mods, you get an invitation to RMRRF. (You can build more mods for additional flight stipends.)
